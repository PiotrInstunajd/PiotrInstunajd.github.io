            <p> I am focused on gaining experience and learning new technologies which will help to develop my career
                and my knowledge to lead even better support. I have gained professional experience as IT support and as
                a support engineer. I have provided hardware support, system administration and application support.</p>
            <p> I am currently working as an Application Support Specialist, where I am responsible for supporting and
                maintaining applications, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring smooth operation of software systems. My
                goal is to become a .NET developer, and I am actively learning C# and .NET technologies to achieve this.
